# Pair Programming with a Large Language Model

This repository contains learning notes, examples, and exercises based on the **[Pair Programming with a Large Language Model](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/pair-programming-llm/)** course by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/ai)**.

The course explores how to effectively **collaborate with large language models (LLMs)** as coding partners. Instead of replacing developers, LLMs act as assistants that can generate, debug, and explain code, allowing humans to stay focused on **critical thinking, design, and decision-making**.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will:

* Understand the fundamentals of **pair programming with an LLM**.
* Learn how to design **string templates** that guide LLM outputs in predictable ways.
* Explore different **pair programming scenarios** to maximize productivity.
* Identify and manage **technical debt** when using AI-generated code.

## üìù Course Topics

### 1. Getting Started

In traditional pair programming, two developers share one computer: one types ("the driver") while the other reviews and suggests improvements ("the navigator"). With an LLM, the AI often takes on the **navigator role**: it can generate ideas, explain concepts, or provide code suggestions, while the human remains in control.

Key concepts:

* **Active collaboration**: You don‚Äôt just accept LLM output blindly‚Äîyou guide it, critique it, and refine it.
* **Prompting as conversation**: Treat prompts like instructions to a partner, not static commands.
* **Strengths of LLMs**: Generating boilerplate code, brainstorming multiple approaches, writing documentation, and explaining complex code.
* **Limitations of LLMs**: May produce incorrect or inefficient solutions, so human oversight is critical.

### 2. Using a String Template

Prompts are the way we "program" an LLM. Instead of vague instructions, structured prompts (or **string templates**) help ensure clarity and consistency.

Key concepts:

* **Prompt structure matters**: A clear format reduces randomness in responses.
* **Variables in templates**: You can design prompts with placeholders to reuse them in multiple contexts.
* **Examples of templates**:

  * Debugging: `"Explain why the following code fails and suggest a fix: {code}"`
  * Documentation: `"Write docstrings for the following function: {function_code}"`
  * Code generation: `"Generate a Python function that {task}, with comments explaining each step."`
* **Benefits**: Predictable output, less ambiguity, and easier integration into tools or workflows.

### 3. Pair Programming Scenarios

LLMs can help at different stages of the software development process:

* **Brainstorming**: Quickly generate multiple possible solutions to a problem.
* **Debugging**: Explain error messages, suggest fixes, or propose alternative implementations.
* **Refactoring**: Suggest cleaner or more efficient ways to write existing code.
* **Test generation**: Automatically produce unit tests based on function behavior.
* **Explaining unfamiliar code**: Translate complex code into human-readable explanations.

Best practices:

* Always **review AI-generated code** before running it.
* Use LLMs for **idea generation**, not final authority.
* Maintain a **back-and-forth dialogue**, refining prompts based on responses.

### 4. Technical Debt

**Technical debt** refers to the long-term costs of quick fixes, shortcuts, or poorly written code. With LLMs, technical debt can accumulate if developers blindly accept suggestions without careful evaluation.

Key concepts:

* **Hidden costs**: LLM-generated code might "work" but may be inefficient, insecure, or poorly documented.
* **Maintainability**: Code produced without human review often lacks long-term clarity.
* **Error propagation**: Incorrect assumptions from the LLM can spread if unchecked.
* **Best practices to reduce debt**:

  * Review all AI-generated code as if written by a junior developer.
  * Add comments and documentation to clarify AI-assisted code.
  * Regularly refactor and simplify complex code.
  * Prioritize readability over cleverness.

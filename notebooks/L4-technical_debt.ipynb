      "4.  **Update `MobileNet.modelInfo`:**  Change the `name` and `extension` in the `MobileNet.modelInfo` enum to match the name of your model file.\n",

Consider using techniques like quantization to reduce the model size and improve performance.  Also, experiment with different `threadCount` values to find the optimal balance between performance and resource usage.\n",

      "Okay, let's break down this Python code snippet step-by-step.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def foo(a):\n",
      "  b = a + 1\n",
      "  return 2*b\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **`def foo(a):`**:\n",
      "   - `def` is a keyword in Python that signifies the beginning of a function definition.  A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
      "   - `foo` is the name we've given to this function.  You can choose almost any valid name for your functions (following Python's naming conventions).  It's good practice to choose a name that describes what the function does.\n",
      "   - `(a)`:  The parentheses enclose the function's *parameters*.  In this case, the function `foo` takes one parameter, which we've named `a`.  A parameter is a variable that the function expects to receive as input when it's called.  Think of it as a placeholder for a value that will be used inside the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`b = a + 1`**:\n",
      "   - This line is inside the function's *body* (the code that gets executed when the function is called).\n",
      "   - `b =`: This is an assignment statement.  It means we're creating a variable named `b` and assigning a value to it.\n",
      "   - `a + 1`: This is an expression that calculates the value to be assigned to `b`.  It takes the value of the parameter `a` (the input to the function) and adds 1 to it.\n",
      "   - So, this line calculates `a + 1` and stores the result in the variable `b`.  `b` is a *local variable* within the function `foo`.  This means it only exists and is accessible within the function's scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **`return 2*b`**:\n",
      "   - `return`: This is a keyword that specifies the value that the function will *return* to the caller.  When a `return` statement is executed, the function's execution stops, and the specified value is sent back to the part of the code that called the function.\n",
      "   - `2*b`: This is another expression. It multiplies the value of the variable `b` by 2.\n",
      "   - So, this line calculates `2 * b` and returns that result.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The function `foo` does the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Takes a number `a` as input.\n",
      "2. Adds 1 to `a` and stores the result in a variable `b`.\n",
      "3. Multiplies `b` by 2.\n",
      "4. Returns the result of that multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Usage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def foo(a):\n",
      "  b = a + 1\n",
      "  return 2*b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = foo(5)  # Call the function with a = 5\n",
      "print(result)    # Output: 12\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation of the Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `result = foo(5)`:\n",
      "   - This line *calls* the function `foo`.\n",
      "   - `foo(5)`:  We're passing the value `5` as the argument to the function.  This means that inside the function, the parameter `a` will have the value `5`.\n",
      "   - The function `foo` will then execute:\n",
      "     - `b = a + 1` becomes `b = 5 + 1`, so `b` will be assigned the value `6`.\n",
      "     - `return 2*b` becomes `return 2 * 6`, so the function will return the value `12`.\n",
      "   - `result = ...`: The value returned by the function (which is `12`) is then assigned to the variable `result`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. `print(result)`:\n",
      "   - This line prints the value of the variable `result` to the console, which will be `12`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Another Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def foo(a):\n",
      "  b = a + 1\n",
      "  return 2*b\n",
      "\n",
      "x = 10\n",
      "y = foo(x)  # Call the function with x as the argument\n",
      "print(y)    # Output: 22\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the variable `x` is used as the argument when calling `foo`.  The value of `x` (which is `10`) is passed to the function, so `a` inside the function will be `10`.  The function will then calculate `b = 10 + 1 = 11` and return `2 * 11 = 22`.  The value `22` is then assigned to the variable `y`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code.\n",
      "* **Parameters:** Input values that a function expects.\n",
      "* **Arguments:** The actual values passed to a function when it's called.\n",
      "* **Return Value:** The value that a function sends back to the caller.\n",
      "* **Local Variables:** Variables that are only accessible within the function where they are defined.\n",
      "* **Scope:** The region of a program where a variable is accessible.\n",
